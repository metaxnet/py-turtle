Yet another implementation of LOGO in python...

This time, aiming to implement as much of UCBLogo commands as
possible, plus support for Left-to-Right languages, starting 
with Hebrew.

Try:

help (prints commands in English and Hebrew to the shell)

repeat 36 [rt 10 repeat 4 [fd 100 rt 90]]

load "tree.lgo
tree 50 (from http://mckoss.com/logo/funprog.htm)

load "15words.lgo (from http://www.mathcats.com/gallery/15wordcontest.html)
